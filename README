DESCRIPTION
    "choose" is a commerical commandline utility for OS X from Tiny Robot
    Software that shows a simple fuzzy-matching GUI for selecting from one
    of several options.

       http://tinyrobotsoftware.com/choose/

    This module is a really really thin wrapper around it that handles the
    shelling out to the process via IPC::Open2.

  Function
    This module exports one function on request, or you can call it fully
    qualified.

    choose @possibilities
        Shows the GUI allowing the user to pick from the possibilities.
        Returns the selected option, or undef if the user canceled the
        selection (by hitting ESC / clicking outside the dialog.)

  Configuring
    This module assumes that the "choose" command line executable has been
    downloaded and installed in your path. If you've installed "choose"
    somewhere outside of your path, you can use the
    $Mac::Choose::executable_path to override the path to the executable.

       local $Mac::Choose::executable_path = "/stuff/bin/choose";
       my $char = choose "Buffy","Willow","Xander","Tara","Oz";
